# eikosany - Algorithmic Composition With Erv Wilson's Combination Product Sets

## What is this?

`eikosany` is an R package of tools for algorithmic composition with Erv
Wilson's Combination Product Sets [@narushima2019microtonality, chapter 6].
It's meant to ***complement*** other microtonal composition tools, not
replace any of them.

About the name: the _Eikosany_ is a 20-note scale derived by Erv Wilson from
the first six odd harmonics in the harmonic series - 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11.

## Other tools?

- [Scala](https://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/). Note: this is ***not*** the
Scala multi-paradigm programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. This is a specialized tool for working with musical scales.
- [Wilsonic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wilsonic/id848852071). This is a
free app that runs on iOS devices. I don't have any iOS devices so I've
never used this.
- [ODDSound MTS-ESP](https://oddsound.com/mtsespsuite.phphttps://oddsound.com/mtsespsuite.php).
This is a plugin for digital audio workstations (DAWs) that facilitates
production of microtonal music. I own a copy and if you're making microtonal
electronic music, you should too. The Eikosany and other scales Erv Wilson
developed all ship with MTS-ESP, so you don't really need my R package to
compose with them.
- [Sevish's Scale Workshop](https://sevish.com/scaleworkshop/guide.htm). This
is a web-based tool for working with musical scales.

## Why did you build it?

I have two main motivations:

1. There's an old saying that if you really want to learn something, teach a
computer to do it. In the case of Erv Wilson's musical constructs, teasing
the construction processes out of his and others' writings on the subject is
a non-trivial task.

    For example, much of Wilson's writing is in the form of
    multi-dimensional graph structures drawn on flat paper. He did build
    physical three-dimensional models of some of them, but some can't even
    be rendered in three dimension.
    
    The graph theory operations that generated them and musical ways to
    traverse them are not at all obvious. One of my long-term goals is to
    write code to draw and traverse these, using DiagrammeR [@Iannone2022a].

2. I own two synthesizers that can remap the keyboard and its associated
MIDI note numbers to arbitrary pitches, an [ASM Hydrasynth
Explorer](https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/hydrasynth-explorer),
and a [Korg Minilogue
XD](https://www.korg.com/us/products/synthesizers/minilogue_xd/). The
Hydrasynth even has the Eikosany and other Combination Product Sets
built-in!

    But I'm not a keyboard player, and even if I were, the remapping
    process for the scales leaves only middle C where a musician would
    normally expect to find it. All the other notes are somewhere else.

    So I need a translator for the music I want to write that doesn't
    involve a lot of trial and error fumbling around on a synthesizer or
    on-screen keyboard. In particular, the playing of chords on a remapped
    synthesizer isn't described in any of the references on Wilson's work
    that I've found.
    
    Music composed using Wilson's musical structures is mostly played on
    instruments custom-built for them. There are keyboards designed for
    Wilson's and other microtonal music; indeed, Wilson himself designed
    microtonal keyboards [@narushima2019microtonality, chapter 2]. But
    they're quite expensive and, like the instruments, custom-built. 

## Road map

I've got the basic scale and chord generation working. The next steps are

1. Verify that the generated scales match all of the Combination Product
Set scales in Sevish's [Eikosany
Pack](https://sevish.com/music-resources/). The Eikosany already does, but
it's easy to write a test harness to check them all.

2. Add a MIDI file writing capability. There are some R packages that do
this but I haven't been able to test them yet. The goal here is to
algorithmically create a MIDI file, load it into a DAW and hear what it
sounds like on the synthesizer hardware. There are some [software
synthesizers that allow MIDI pitch remapping (look for "Full-keyboard
microtuning")](https://en.xen.wiki/w/List_of_microtonal_software_plugins),
so if you want to try this, you don't need to buy a synthesizer.

That's pretty much it for release 1.0. Once I have the capability to write
MIDI files programmatically, I can think about long-term goals. As I noted
above, one of them is to develop graph rendering and traversal tools for all
of Wilson's constructs.
