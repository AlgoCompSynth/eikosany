## What is this?

`eikosany` is a collection of tools for algorithmic composition with Erv
Wilson's Combination Product Sets [@narushima2019microtonality, chapter 6].
It's meant to ***complement*** other microtonal composition tools, not
replace any of them.

## Other tools?

- [Scala](https://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/). Note: this is ***not*** the
Scala mulit-paradigm programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. This is a specialized tool for dealing with musical scales.
- [Wilsonic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wilsonic/id848852071). This is a
free app that runs on iOS devices. I don't have any iOS devices so I've
never used this.
- [ODDSound MTS-ESP](https://oddsound.com/mtsespsuite.phphttps://oddsound.com/mtsespsuite.php).
This is a plugin for digital audio workstations (DAWs) that facilitates
production of microtonal music. I own a copy and if you're making microtonal
electronic music, you should too. The eikosany and other scales Erv Wilson
developed all ship with MTS-ESP, so you don't really need my R package to
compose with them.
- [Sevish's Scale Workshop](https://sevish.com/scaleworkshop/guide.htm). This
is a web-based tool for working with musical scales.

## Why did you build it?

I have two main motivations:

1. There's an old saying that if you really want to learn something, teach a
computer to do it. In the case of Erv Wilson's musical constructs, teasing
the construction processes out of his and others' writings on the subject is
a non-trivial task.

    For example, much of Wilson's writing is in the form of multi-dimensional
    graph structures drawn on flat paper. The graph theory operations that
    generated them and musical ways to traverse them are not at all obvious.
    One of my long-term goals is to write code to draw these using
    DiagrammeR [@Iannone2022a].

2. I own two synthesizers that can remap the keyboard and its associated MIDI
note numbers to arbitrary pitches, an
[ASM Hydrasynth Explorer](https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/hydrasynth-explorer),
and a
[Korg Minilogue XD](https://www.korg.com/us/products/synthesizers/minilogue_xd/).
But I'm not a keyboard player, and even if I were, the remapping process for
the scales leaves only middle C where a musician would normally expect to
find it. All the other notes are somewhere else.

    So I need a translator for the music I want to write that doesn't
    involve a lot of trial and error fumbling around on a synthesizer or
    on-screen keyboard. And how to play chords isn't described anywhere in
    any of the references on Wilson's work that I've found - it's unique to
    custom-built instruments in most cases.

## Road map

I've got the basic scale and chord generation working. The next steps are

1. Verify that the generated scales match all of the eikosany scales in
Sevish's [Eikosany Pack](https://sevish.com/music-resources/). The eikosany
already does, but it's easy to write a test harness to check them all.

2. Add a MIDI file writing capability. There are some R packages that do this
but I haven't been able to test them yet. The goal here is to be able to
algorithmically create a MIDI file, load it into a DAW and hear what it
sounds like on the synthesizer hardware. There are some [software
synthesizers that allow MIDI pitch remapping (look for "Full-keyboard
microtuning")](https://en.xen.wiki/w/List_of_microtonal_software_plugins), so
if you want to try this, you don't need to buy a synthesizer.

That's pretty much it for release 1.0. Once I have the capability to write
MIDI files programmatically, I can think about long-term goals. As I noted
above, one of them is to develop graph rendering and traversal tools for all
of Wilson's constructs.
