# eikosany - Algorithmic Composition With Erv Wilson’s Combination Product Sets

## Overview

`eikosany` is an R package of tools for algorithmic composition with Erv
Wilson’s Combination Product Sets (Narushima 2019, chap. 6). It’s meant
to ***complement*** other microtonal composition tools, not replace any
of them. `eikosany` is part of the `xen.assist` project for xentonal
algorithmic composition.

About the name: an *Eikosany* is a 20-note scale derived by Erv Wilson
from six harmonic factors. Although any six factors can be used, the
most commonly encountered Eikosany uses the first six odd numbers: 1, 3,
5, 7, 9 and 11.

## Other tools

- [Scala](https://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/). Note: this is
  ***not*** the Scala multi-paradigm programming language that runs on
  the Java Virtual Machine. This is a specialized tool for working with
  musical scales.

- [Sevish’s Scale Workshop](https://sevish.com/scaleworkshop/guide.htm).
  This is a web-based tool for working with musical scales.

- [Leimma and Apotome](https://isartum.net/). These tools, by [Khyam
  Allami](https://khyamallami.com/) and
  [Counterpoint](https://ctpt.co/), are browser-based applications for
  creating microtonal scales and making generative music with them.

- [ODDSound MTS-ESP](https://oddsound.com/mtsespsuite.php). This is a
  plugin for digital audio workstations (DAWs) that facilitates
  production of microtonal music. I own a copy and if you’re making
  microtonal electronic music, you should too. The Eikosany and other
  scales Erv Wilson developed all ship with MTS-ESP, so you don’t really
  need my R package to compose with them.

- [Entonal Studio](https://entonal.studio/). Entonal Studio is a user
  interface package for microtonal composition. It can operate as a
  standalone application, a plugin host or a plugin. I own a copy of
  Entonal Studio and recommend it highly.

- [Infinitone DMT](https://infinitone.com/). From the [Infinitone DMT
  FAQ](https://infinitone.com/support/#faq-container): “Infinitone DMT
  is a DAW plugin and standalone that empowers musicians to easily use
  micro-tuning within their own workflow. …

  “As a plugin, Infinitone DMT is inserted in your DAW as a MIDI effect.
  … The standalone can be used separately from a DAW, or it can be used
  in conjunction with a DAW by routing MIDI data from the DAW to the
  standalone (and back).”

- [Universal Tuning Editor](https://hpi.zentral.zone/ute). Universal
  Tuning Editor is an application for computing and visualizing
  microtonal scales and tunings, and includes tools to interface with
  hardware and software synthesizers.

- [Wilsonic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wilsonic/id848852071). This
  is a free app that runs on iOS devices. I don’t have any iOS devices
  so I’ve never used this.

  There is also a version of Wilsonic in development for use with
  ODDSound MTS-ESP. See
  <https://wilsonic.co/downloads/downloads-mts-esp/> for the details.

- [Surge XT](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/). Surge XT is an open
  source full featured software synthesizer. The Surge XT community has
  invested a significant level of effort into supporting alternate
  tuning systems.

See the [Xenharmonic Wiki List of microtonal software
plugins](https://en.xen.wiki/w/List_of_microtonal_software_plugins) for
more ways of making microtonal music.
