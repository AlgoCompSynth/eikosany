# eikosany - Algorithmic Composition With Erv Wilson’s Combination Product Sets

## Overview

`eikosany` is an R package of tools for algorithmic composition with Erv
Wilson’s Combination Product Sets (Narushima 2019, chap. 6). It’s meant
to ***complement*** other microtonal composition tools, not replace any
of them.

About the name: an *Eikosany* is a 20-note scale derived by Erv Wilson
from six harmonic factors. Although any six factors can be used, the
most commonly encountered Eikosany uses the first six odd numbers: 1, 3,
5, 7, 9 and 11.

## Other tools

- [Scala](https://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/). Note: this is
  ***not*** the Scala multi-paradigm programming language that runs on
  the Java Virtual Machine. This is a specialized tool for working with
  musical scales.

- [Sevish’s Scale Workshop](https://sevish.com/scaleworkshop/guide.htm).
  This is a web-based tool for working with musical scales.

- [Leimma and Apotome](https://isartum.net/). These tools, by [Khyam
  Allami](https://khyamallami.com/) and
  [Counterpoint](https://ctpt.co/), are browser-based applications for
  creating microtonal scales and making generative music with them.

- [ODDSound MTS-ESP](https://oddsound.com/mtsespsuite.php). This is a
  plugin for digital audio workstations (DAWs) that facilitates
  production of microtonal music. I own a copy and if you’re making
  microtonal electronic music, you should too. The Eikosany and other
  scales Erv Wilson developed all ship with MTS-ESP, so you don’t really
  need my R package to compose with them.

- [Entonal Studio](https://entonal.studio/). Entonal Studio is a user
  interface package for microtonal composition. It can operate as a
  standalone application, a plugin host or a plugin. I own a copy of
  Entonal Studio and recommend it highly.

- [Infinitone DMT](https://infinitone.com/). From the [Infinitone DMT
  FAQ](https://infinitone.com/support/#faq-container): “Infinitone DMT
  is a DAW plugin and standalone that empowers musicians to easily use
  micro-tuning within their own workflow. …

  “As a plugin, Infinitone DMT is inserted in your DAW as a MIDI effect.
  … The standalone can be used separately from a DAW, or it can be used
  in conjunction with a DAW by routing MIDI data from the DAW to the
  standalone (and back).”

- [Universal Tuning Editor](https://hpi.zentral.zone/ute). Universal
  Tuning Editor is an application for computing and visualizing
  microtonal scales and tunings, and includes tools to interface with
  hardware and software synthesizers.

- [Wilsonic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wilsonic/id848852071). This
  is a free app that runs on iOS devices. I don’t have any iOS devices
  so I’ve never used this.

  There is also a version of Wilsonic in development for use with
  ODDSound MTS-ESP. See
  <https://wilsonic.co/downloads/downloads-mts-esp/> for the details.

- [Surge XT](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/). Surge XT is an open
  source full featured software synthesizer. The Surge XT community has
  invested a significant level of effort into supporting alternate
  tuning systems.

See the [Xenharmonic Wiki List of microtonal software
plugins](https://en.xen.wiki/w/List_of_microtonal_software_plugins) for
more ways of making microtonal music.

## Some history

On February 4, 2001, composer Iannis Xenakis passed away. I’ve been a
fan of experimental music, especially *musique concrète*,
algorithmically composed music, microtonal music, and other
*avant-garde* genres since I was an undergraduate. Xenakis was one of
the major figures in algorithmic composition.

Reading the first edition of *Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale* [^1]
rekindled my appreciation for the microtonal music of Harry Partch. And
so, armed with copies of Sethares (1998), *Formalized Music* [^2], and
*Genesis of a Music* [^3], I embarked on a path that led to *When Harry
Met Iannis* [^4].

*When Harry Met Iannis* was premiered at a microtonal music festival in
El Paso, Texas in late October, 2001. The [Bandcamp
version](https://algocompsynth.bandcamp.com/album/when-harry-met-iannis)
is essentially identical to that version; the source code is on GitHub
at <https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/when-harry-met-iannis>.

At the festival, I met a number of composers who were working in
microtonal and just intonation, and one name kept coming up: Erv Wilson.
Wilson was a theoretician who developed keyboards, scales and tuning
systems that several composers were using at the time, and are still
using today. Terumi Narushima’s *Microtonality and the Tuning Systems of
Erv Wilson* [^5] is a comprehensive documentation of Wilson’s work and
is the basis for much of the code in this package.

## Motivation

I have two main motivations:

1.  There’s an old saying that if you really want to learn something,
    teach a computer to do it. In the case of Erv Wilson’s musical
    constructs, teasing the construction processes out of his and
    others’ writings on the subject is a non-trivial task.

    For example, much of Wilson’s work consists of multi-dimensional
    graph structures drawn on flat paper. He did build physical
    three-dimensional models of some of them, but some can’t even be
    rendered in three dimensions. And the graph theory operations that
    generated them and musical ways to traverse them are not at all
    obvious.

2.  The 20th anniversary of Xenakis’ passing and of *When Harry Met
    Iannis* occured in my second year of virtual isolation because of
    COVID-19. During 2021, I acquired two synthesizers that are capable
    of mapping the keyboards to arbitrary microtonal scales: an [Ashun
    Sound Machines Hydrasynth
    Desktop](https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/hydrasynth-desk), and a
    [Korg Minilogue
    XD](https://www.korg.com/us/products/synthesizers/minilogue_xd/).

    The Hydrasynth ships with the tuning tables for many of Erv Wilson’s
    scales already in the firmware. For the Minilogue XD, the user can
    load up to six custom scales with a software librarian program.

    But I’m not a keyboard player, and even if I were, the remapping
    process for the scales leaves only middle C where a musician would
    normally expect to find it. All the other notes are somewhere else.

    So I need a translator for the music I want to write that doesn’t
    involve a lot of trial and error fumbling around on a remapped
    synthesizer or on-screen keyboard. CPS scales are aimed at harmonic
    musical structures like chords, and finding them on a remapped
    keyboard is tedious and error-prone.

    Music composed using Wilson’s musical structures is mostly played on
    instruments custom-built for them. There are keyboards designed for
    Wilson’s and other microtonal music; indeed, Wilson himself designed
    microtonal keyboards (Narushima 2019, chap. 2). But they’re quite
    expensive and, like the instruments, custom-built. I need tools to
    work with what I have.

## Developer notes

### Project status update 2023-09-06:

I presented the project in its current state at the Cascadia R
Conference on August 19th, 2023. The slides and some sample data are at
<https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/eikosany-slides>. I have now begun
what I am calling “The Great Refactor”. Approximate road map:

1.  “Finish” [consonaR](https://algocompsynth.github.io/consonaR/). I am
    moving most of the scale, keyboard, interval, spectral analysis and
    synthesis functionality in `eikosany` to `consonaR`. I am also
    adding functionality to `consonaR` to facilitate algorithmic
    composition in the frequency domain. This *may* include a real-time
    synthesis capability if I can find a way to make that work on
    Windows, MacOS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Raspberry Pi OS. It definitely
    will include the current synthesis functionality based on `seewave`
    and `tuneR`.

2.  Replace much of the low-level functionality in `eikosany` with calls
    to the equivalents in `consonaR`.

3.  Removing the MIDI functionality from `eikosany`. First of all,
    performing composed microtonal music on hardware and software
    synthesizers that support it is a solved problem, using the other
    tools listed above. Second, MIDI is a terrible score language for
    the kind of music I want to make.

    Open Sound Control (OSC) *may* be better, but I’m not convinced. I’d
    much prefer a language that facilitates live coding / performance as
    a human / computer interface over a communication protocol like MIDI
    or OSC. [CLAMS](https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/CLAMS) is my
    approach.

### Moving forward

If you’re interested in helping with the development of this package, a
few notes:

1.  While you *can* install this package via
    `remotes::install("eikosany")`, it will be easier for me if you fork
    the repository <https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/eikosany.git> and
    install it via `devtools::install(dependencies = TRUE)`. I don’t
    recommend using the package without RStudio; there may well be
    hidden dependencies on it. I regularly run `R CMD check` and you
    should too.

2.  I am tracking Wilsonic MTS-ESP and Surge XT and am more or less
    constantly re-scoping this project to avoid duplicating those
    capabilities. So if I get a feature request that’s covered by one of
    them, I’ll most likely send you there.

3.  I have another project in the works that will be ramping up in
    September. [CLAMS](https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/CLAMS) is a
    Forth-based real-time synthesis toolset for embedded environments.
    So my development time will be divided between the two projects.

    There *will* be integrations between the two projects, mostly so I
    can use R Markdown and Quarto for literate programming and
    documentation, and so the synthesizer can make algorithmic
    microtonal music.
