\description{
For scale tables created using function \code{et_scale_table}, the user must
specify note names. As a convenience, the \code{eikosany} package includes
data sets for \verb{12EDO}, \verb{19EDO}, and \verb{31EDO}.
}
\details{
Even in 2023, code often breaks when given
characters outside the 7-bit international standard. So we don't even
have flats, let alone half-flats, half-sharps, naturals, or any of the
other symbols alternate tuning theorists have proposed.

So for scales created with equal divisions of the octave, we use a
"/b" for a half-flat, "b" for a flat, "bb" for a double-flat, /#"
for a half-sharp, "#" for a sharp. and "##" for a double-sharp. Thanks
in advance for your understanding.
