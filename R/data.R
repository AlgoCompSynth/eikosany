#' Note names for 12EDO
#'
#' For scale tables created using function `et_scale_table`, the user must
#' specify note names. As a convenience, the `eikosany` package includes
#' data sets for `12EDO`, `19EDO`, and `31EDO`.
#'
#' Even in 2023, code often breaks when given
#' characters outside the 7-bit international standard. So we don't even
#' have flats, let alone half-flats, half-sharps, naturals, or any of the
#' other symbols alternate tuning theorists have proposed.
#'
#' So for scales created with equal divisions of the octave, we use a
#' "/b" for a half-flat, "b" for a flat, "bb" for a double-flat, /#"
#' for a half-sharp, "#" for a sharp. and "##" for a double-sharp. Thanks
#' in advance for your understanding.
